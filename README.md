What is VARVI?
--------------

VARVI is a free software tool developed to perform heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in response to different visual stimuli. The tool was developed after realizing that this type of studies are becoming popular in fields such as psychiatry, psychology and marketing, and taking into account the lack of specific tools for this purpose.
