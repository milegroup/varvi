What is VARVI?
--------------

VARVI (heart rate Variability Analysis in Response to Visual stImuli) is a free software tool developed to perform heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in response to different visual stimuli. The tool was developed after realizing that this type of studies are becoming popular in fields such as psychiatry, psychology and marketing, and taking into account the lack of specific tools for this purpose.

VARVI allows the users to obtain Heart Rate (HR) records from subjects who are watching video files. Each video file will be labelled with a tag, and the HR record will contain information of these tags with their corresponding time intervals.
